# Simple Political Compass Quiz   

## About
A small political compass quiz project to test Python web and image manipulation libraries.   
The admin password is P@55word but can be changed in  json/admin_user (note: sha256 is used to hash).   
As this is a small project with little persistant data I use JSON to persist.

## Technologies used:
* Python 3.8.5+  
* Flask 1.1.2+   
* Pillow 8.0.1+

Front-end is handled with Bootstrap.
