    "intro_text": "The underlying theory of the political compass model is that political ideology may be better measured along two separate, independent axes. The economic (left-right) axis measures one's opinion of how the economy should be run: 'left' is defined as the desire for the economy to be run by a cooperative collective agency (which can mean the state, but can also mean a network of communes) while 'right' is defined as the desire for the economy to be left to the devices of competing individuals and organizations. The other axis (authoritarian-libertarian) measures one's political opinions in a social sense, regarding the amount of personal freedom that one would allow: 'libertarianism' is defined as the belief that personal freedom should be maximised while 'authoritarianism' is defined as the belief that authority should be obeyed. The purpose of this project is to test where you are on a political compass through a series of questions.",
